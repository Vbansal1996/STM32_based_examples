> This is example interface where we are communicating Cypress CY8CMBR3108 with Stm32G0 Controller over I2C interface.
> Example represents only how to communicate with Touch IC and manage touch interrupts.
> IC is configured with some pre-defined configurations. User can change then in TouchSensor.c file.
> Please read the data sheet and register set for the same to manage the touch sensitivity.
> Interface Libraries are take from Cypress Semiconductors.
> This is a basic example which can later be upgraded as per the user needs.
